\textbf{A short description of the business process and the granularity.
List also considered alternatives, if any.
Give also between 4 and 8 examples of queries you want to be able to answer.}

\subsection{Business Processes}
The fclub's main purpose is to sell its products to its members.
We have found two business processes in the fclub that we can model:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sales of products to members.
	\item Payments from the members.
\end{itemize}

In this miniproject we have chosen to focus on the business process that describes the sales.


\subsection{Granularity}
For the chosen business process we wish to be able to see each individual sales.
This means that the data in the data warehouse will be of high granularity. \\
\\
It is possible to choose a lower granularity, such as modeling sales by grouping each sale by the product by the hour.
This however disables us from doing some statistics, such as the purchases made by each member.


\subsection{Queries}
We aim to design our data warehouse to be able to answer the following queries:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the most popular product?
	\item What are the sales for a specific product grouped by different time measures (events, week-day, hour etc.).
	\item Which products are most popular at the different rooms?
	\item What are the sales for a specific member?
	\item When are sales the highest?
	\item When are most members purchasing products?
\end{itemize}
