We model the sales on a per sale basis. We use two fact tables to keep track of the information necessary, Table~\ref{tab:salesFactTable} and Table~\ref{tab:balanceFactTable}, representing the value of each sale and the balance of members, respectively. Table~\ref{tab:salesFactTable} has the dimensions Time, Product, Location, and Member, which will be explained momentarily. Table~\ref{tab:balanceFactTable} has the dimensions Time and Member. We chose to create a fact table for balance instead of having it within the Member dimension, as the balance will change with every purchase and thus our Member dimension would grow as quickly as our fact table. This is because balance is a rapidly changing dimension.


\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        Time (Tid) & Product (Pid) & Location (Lid) & Member (Mid) & Sale \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fact Table for Sales}
    \label{tab:salesFactTable}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        Time (Tid) & Member (Mid) & Balance \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fact Table for Balance}
    \label{tab:balanceFactTable}
\end{table}

The Time dimension is shown in Table~\ref{tab:timeDimensionTable}, and contains nothing special. The Product dimension is shown in Table~\ref{tab:productDimensionTable} and contains the slowly changing dimension Price, since products' price might increase or decrease over time. The Location dimension shown in Table~\ref{tab:locationDimensionTable} keeps track of where/in which context every purchase has been performed. Lastly the Member dimension shown in Table~\ref{tab:memberDimensionTable} contains every member within the fclub. Each member has an id in the system, which we will present with the UserId, this is because surrogate keys should always be used, in case updates might happen.
