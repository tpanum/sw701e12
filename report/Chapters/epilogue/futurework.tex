\section{Future work}

\projectname{} in its current state is, as mentioned previously, a proof of concept.
It is not ready to market yet. 
A couple of things has to be fixed or implemented in order to make it fully ready to market. 
These are considered future work and are covered in this section. \\

A number of the accepts testes were not accepted when the tests were run.
These can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:testing_report}.
All of the tests that were not accepted must be implemented / fixed before \projectname{} is ready to market. \\

As described in Section~\ref{sec:testing_approach} only dynamic black-box testing (acceptance tests) were run on \projectname{} to verify that it is implemented as planned and designed.
When moving the project from a proof of concept state to a ready to market state, we believe that dynamic white box testing (unit testing) is necessary in order to ensure that the system works 100\% correct at all times, given any input. \\

As described in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, the streaming implemented in \projectname{} now is not a solution that can be shipped to the market. 
The solution that was originally planned for implementation -- or a similar solution where the video feed is displayed in the clients browser -- must be implemented into \projectname{} before it is ready to market.
