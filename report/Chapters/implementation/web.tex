\section{Web-interface}
The web-interface is implemented using Rails as described in Section~\ref{sec:programming_language}.
This framework enforces a number of standards that is followed in the implementation of the web-interface.
The most significant is CRUD, mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:master}.
The web-interface is implemented using the design mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:master} and Appendix~\ref{app:controller_actions}.
A number of Rails-specific tools, named \emph{Gems} \citep{Rails_Gems}, which are plugins for Rails written by the community, provides us with a number of tools that we can use and build our own application on. 
Five different Gems are used in \projectname{}. 
These are: \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item mysql2
	\item daemons-rails
	\item eventmachine
	\item sht\_rails
	\item swfobject-rails
\end{itemize}

\projectname{} uses a relational MySQL database to store all informations in.
Ruby and Rails is not able to connect with MySQL out of the box. 
Therefore the \emph{mysql2} \citep{Rails_mysql2} gem is is used, which provides a simple interface for Ruby to connect with a MySQL database.

The daemons-rails \citep{Rails_daemons_rails} is used for the daemon running in \deno{M}. 
It accepts incoming requests from \deno{S}'s and uses the models in the web-application to interact with these.
To make sure that the daemon can use these, the damons-rails gem is used.

The Eventmachine Gem \citep{Rails_eventmachine} is used to allow our web-application to easily interact with other programs using TCP/IP.
The daemon running on \deno{M} also uses this to communicate with \deno{S}'s when exchanging informations regarding session keys. 
Whenever a user requests access to a drone, the request of a session key is saved in the database. 
The daemon running on \deno{M} takes this request and uses the eventmachine to connect to the \deno{S} associated with the drone that the user wishes to interact with, in order to sync session keys and verify that the connection between the user and drone is valid. 

SHT\_Rails \emph{Shared Handlebars Template for Rails} \citep{Rails_sht_rails} is used in the view of the web-interface and enables the application to render a view both as html and json, making it easier to integrate AJAX functionalities.

The SWFObject Gem \citep{Rails_swfobject} allows us to easily display a swf flash object in the view of \projectname{}. \\
