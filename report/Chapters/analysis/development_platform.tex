\section{Development Platform}
At this point we know that we will need a varity of different functions and methods to make the systems as descriped.
The problem domain implies that we need both web development and server-side scripting. 
Therefore we have decided to use the programming language Ruby and the web development framework Ruby on Rails as this gives us a number of advantages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ruby itself is easy to install server-side.
	\item Ruby works well as a server-side scripting language.
	\item Rails provide an easy-to-use framework for web-development with Ruby.
\end{itemize}

Ruby is a object oriented scripting language.
Besides working as a server-side scripting language it also works for web programming as several different webservers - e.g. Apache - has modules to support Ruby. 

Ruby on Rails is a open-source web framework for Ruby that's optimized to make programming as easy and efficient as possible. 
By using this framework on the web application side of the project, we give ourselves and the project an advantage as this provides a lot of build-in features, such as support for the MVC model, ActiveRecords etc. that enables us to be more efficient and write better quality code.

Keeping in mind that this is a student project, Ruby is also a natural choise as we in the group have little to no knowledge of how Ruby works. 
This is a great oppotunity for us to lean how to use another programming language. \\

We also know that we will be communicating long distance with the drone. 
This will require some sort of server or gateway between the web application and the drone.
We also already know that we have to build some web application and server side scripting which both requires some soft of hosting.
We have decided to use Linux Debian for this purpose, as Linux provides a lot of useful and built-in features for hosting both web applications, server side scripting and databases.
