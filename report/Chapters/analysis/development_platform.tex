\section{Development Platform}
At this point we know that we will need a varity of different functions and methods to make the systems required. 
A large part of the system will be web-based programming and server-side-scripts. 
Therefore we have decided to work with Ruby and Ruby on Rails as this gives us a number of advantages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ruby itself is easy to install server-side.
	\item Ruby works well as a server-side scripting language.
	\item Rails provide an easy-to-use framework for web-development with Ruby.
\end{itemize}

Ruby is a object oriented scripting language.
Besides working as a server-side scripting language it also works for web programming as several different webservers - including e.g. Apache - has modules to support Ruby. 

Ruby on Rails is a open-source web framework for Ruby that's optimized to make programming as easy and efficient as possible. 
By using this framework on the web application side of the project, we give ourselves and the project an advantage as this provides a lot of build-in features, such as support for the MVC model, ActiveRecords etc. that enables us to be more efficient and write better quality code.

Keeping in mind that this is a student project, Ruby is also a natural choise as we in the group have little to no knowledge of how Ruby works. 
This is a great oppotunity for us to lean how to use another programming language.
