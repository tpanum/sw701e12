%Hvad er formÂlet med acceptance tests
%Hvordan er de linket til Use cases
%Link til design
The development method used in this project makes use of acceptance tests, see Section~\ref{sec:developmet_method}.
Acceptance tests are associated with use cases, and must be passed in order for a use case to have been implemented.
The acceptance tests are written based on the use cases and can be seen in Figure~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests1} and Figure~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests2}.
A use case may have several acceptance test associated with it.
In Figure~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests1} and Figure~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests2} the column \textbf{Use Case ID} refers to the use case the acceptance is associated with.
The use case IDs can be seen in Figure~\ref{tab:use_cases}.\\
