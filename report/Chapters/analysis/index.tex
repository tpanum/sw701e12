\chapter{Analysis}
% Hvad skal analyseres?
% Hvorfor analyserer vi det?
In this chapter the problem domain for the problem statement defined in Section~\ref{sec:problem_definition} is analysed.
The problem domain is video surveillance of large outdoor areas.
In the analysis the potential issues with implementing the posed solution are identified and presented.
Based on the analysis a set of requirements to the application is presented and based on these set of use cases defining the functionality of the system is constructed.

%In order to develop an appropriate application, which addresses the issues outlined in Section~\ref{sec:problem_definition}, the problem domain must be analyzed.
%Analyzing the problem domain ensures that the application corresponds to the requirements of the user.
