\section{Development Method}
We have had experience with different development methods from previous semesters.
There we learned to take advantage of using stand-up meetings, making short and precise iterations and to postpone tasks to the next iteration if not completed. 
We are, however, aware that Scrum might not fit exactly on this project.
Therefore we have analyzed what is required from this project and how we need to modify Scrum in order to fit to our needs. \\

We will implement all the principles from Scrum. In addition to this, we have changed and/or added the following to our modified version of Scrum:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pair programming. We have decided to add the principles of pair programming, found in XP, to our project. We are working in an area of great uncertainty, as we have no prior experience with a lot of the problem domain. To lower the number of errors and faster get an understanding of our system, we have decided to implement Pair Programming.
	\item Refactoring. Also do to the uncertainty of this project, we have added refactoring sessions to our iterations. These are also normally found in XP. They are added to enable us to improve our code over time. 
\end{itemize}
