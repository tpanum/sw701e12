\section{Requirements}
The superficial requirements of \projectname{} are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A user must be able to log in to the system.
	\item The system must have security measures in place to make sure any user only sees what he is permitted to. 
	\item A drone must be able to send its video feed to the web service.
	\item A drone must be controllable from the web service. 
	\item The system must support multiple drones and users. 
\end{itemize}

These requirements are the base line for the use cases, which will be used to define the final requirements of the system.
