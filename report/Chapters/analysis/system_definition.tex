\section{System Definition}
\projectname{} is a web service for surveilling large areas in a dynamic way. 
The system will be based on a movable device that can record videos. 
We will implement this device in the form of a drone. 
We define a drone as a device - an agent - that is capable of flight and video recording and video streaming.
The service will be accessible via a web browser, where one or more users will be able to view the video feed from one or more drones and control their movements. 
The drone is controlled through keyboard gestures with a streamed video feed providing visual information about the drone's physical environment. 
\projectname{} connects one or more users to a physical drone through their browser. 
Before a connection is established the user is authenticated in order to provide security features.

By accessing and authenticating on the website, the user should be able to view a number of drones that the user has access to.
The user should then be able to enter detailed view of each of these in order to view the video stream and/or control the drone's flight remotely. 
The access control (which users has access to which drones) is managed by an administrative user.
Therefore the system will also implement different security levels, user- and group structures.
