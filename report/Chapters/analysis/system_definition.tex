\section{System Definition}
\projectname{} is a web service for surveilling large areas with cameras mounted on drones.
The service will be accessible via a web browser.
Each drone can only be controlled by one user at a time.
Several users can view one drone's video feed simultaneously.
The drone is controlled through keyboard gestures with a streamed video feed providing visual information about the drone's physical environment. 
\projectname{} connects one or more users to a physical drone through their browser.
Before a connection is established the user is authenticated.
By accessing and authenticating on the website, the user should be able to view a number of drones that the user has access to.
The user should be able to enter a detailed view of each of these in order to view the video stream and/or control the drone's flight remotely. 
The access control, i.e. which users has access to which drones, is managed by an administrative user.
