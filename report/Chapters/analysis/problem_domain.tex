\section{Problem Domain}
In trying to construct a solution to the problem statement, we will address some different domains in relation to the problem. We have already learned that the solution to this problem will consists of two parts: One or more drones and a web application to control this. \\

The idenfied problem domains are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wireless short-distance and wired long-distance communication with and control of a drone via TCP and/or UDP. We know that a drone will be near an area that it shall survail, and that the operator may be located far away. Therefore it is nessecary that the the system can communicate over long distances. 
	\item Wireless short-distance and wired long-distance video streaming via TCP and/or UDP. As with communication the drone must be able to send back a video feed of what it sees. Therefore the system must also be able to send back a real-time video feed over long distances. 
	\item Interaction with the drone via a web application. It is already decided that the user must be able to control the drone via a web application. Therefore we need to look into how one can do this, knowing that the web is a state-less environment. 
	\item Permissions- and access control in the web application. The web application will have support for several users and drones. Therefore security measures must be taken to ensure that the users can only access their own drones.
\end{itemize}

These are all areas that needs study to be understood before a solution that solves the problem can be constructed, as this will build on these principles.
