\section{Use cases}
The functionality of the system will be defined through use cases, describing how a user of the system would desire to interact with the system.
Each use case must be associated with an acceptance test, which must be passed in order for the use case to have been fully implemented.
The use cases can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:use_cases}.
How these are actually implemented and tested will be described in Section~\ref{???}.
