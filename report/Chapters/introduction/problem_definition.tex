\section{Problem Definition}
Video surveillance is static and as a concesequence a large ammount of hardware is required to properly surveil an area.
This is problematic for people and large companies with a large ammount of valuables to protect.
Drone technology offers a possible solution to this problem by making video surveillance dynamic through moveable cameras.
This possible solution yields the following preliminary problem statement:\\
\textit{How can drone technology be applied in a software application to improve video surveillance?}\\

From the preliminary problem statement the following aspects must be considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to control a drone through the application
	\item How to make the application scalable to support more than drone
	\item How the make the system accesible in a secure manner
\end{itemize}
