\section{Problem Definition}
Video surveillance is static and as a concesequence a large amount of hardware is required to properly surveil an area.
This is problematic when a large area has to be survailed, as it requires a lot of hardware.
Drone technology offers a possible solution to this problem by making video surveillance dynamic through moveable cameras.
This possible solution yields the following preliminary problem statement:\\

\textit{How can drone technology be applied in a software application to improve the effeciency of video surveillance?}\\

From the preliminary problem statement the following aspects must be considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to control a drone through the application
	\item How to make the application scalable to support more than one drone
	\item How the make the system accesible from remote locations in a secure manner
\end{itemize}
