\section{Video Surveillance}\label{sec:video_surveillance}
Video surveillance is widely used to obtain documentation or evidence of a crime, or as a preventive tool.
As an example there is one camera for every 32 people in the United Kingdom \citep{london_camera_surveillance}.
This number includes both cameras installed by the government to surveil London, but also cameras installed by businesses to secure their property.
The high number of cameras is partially attributed to the high need for surveillance to prevent e.g. terrorist attacks, but additionally due to the technical difficulties of video surveillance. \\

A typical video surveillance solution consists of cameras connected via cables to a control station.
Video cameras are mounted on a fixed location, and can therefore only surveil an area limited by their field of view, see Figure~\ref{fig:camera_properties}, and the environment in which it is placed.\\

An environment can contain physical objects which limits the camera's field of view further, see Figure~\ref{fig:refular_camera_setup}.
In small environments a sufficient degree of surveillance can be achieved without too much difficulty or cost (based on the interview described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:lytzen_it}).
Properly surveilling large areas is however problematic and can be expensive in regard to required hardware and installation costs such as digging down cables i.e.:

%The need for video surveillance is based on the need for documentation of crimes, which is required in case of damage loses from an insurance perspective.
%Should a break-in occur a definitive proof of such must often be presented in order for insurances to cover potential losses.

A camera's field of view is not a hard limit for what it can record, however only what is recorded within the field of view is of high enough quality to be used as documentation.
%Video cameras have a limited field of view, both in terms of vision and range, and only within this field of view is the quality high enough be usable as documentation.
This limitation can make it difficult and resource intensive to surveil large areas.
The resource intensitivity stems from the amount of hardware required to surveil, referring both to cameras and cables needed to connect the surveillance system.
The difficulty in surveilling the areas comes from the nature of an outdoor environment.
In terms of surveillance an indoor environment can be seen as static, as there is a limited amount of entrances and the interior of the buildings in terms of walls and doors remain the same.
In an outdoor environment the weather has to be taken into account.
The weather can be foggy or rainy and the sun can blind a camera if it is improperly placed.
These conditions make video surveillance of outdoor areas difficult.
Both indoors and outdoors have some challenges that need to be faced, such as physical objects being moved around creating blind spots, etc.
