\section{System Definition}
\projectname{} is a web service for multi drone-based surveillance. 
It allows a user to access and control a drone. 
We define a drone as a device - an agent - that is capible of flight and video recording and video streaming. 
The drone is controlled through keyboard gestures with a streamed video feed providing visual information about the drone's physical environment. \projectname{} connects the user to a physical drone through their browser. 
Before a connection is established the user is authenticated in order to provide security features.

By accessing and authendicating on the website, the user should be able to view a number of drones that the user has access to.
The user should then be able to enter detailed view of each of these in order to view the video stream and/or control the drone's flight remotely. 
The access control (which users has access to which drones) is managed by an administrative user.
Therefore the system will also implement different security levels, user- and group structures.
