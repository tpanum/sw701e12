%In this chapter we will give a short introduction to the project, why we have chosen to work in this area and where the focus in the rest of this report lies. \\

%This student report is written as part of a learning project. Therefore we must comply with the study regulation.
%The study regulation states that the main focus of this semester's project is to gain knowledge of, and develop: Internet applications, -agents, or -services.
%The goal is thus to create an Internet application that provides a service with focus on agent technologies, scalability, and data intensity. \\

When a crime occurs documentation is often needed in order to convict the person(s) responsible and to receive payment from an insurance company for the loss suffered.
Documentation can be eye witnesses, forensic evidence, or video surveillance.
Eye witnesses or forensic evidence are unreliable sources for documentation, since it is not possible to guarantee they will be available.
Documentation from eye witnesses or forensic evidence are unreliable sources, as it is not possible to guarantee it will be available.
Video surveillance is however always obtainable in the case where one or more cameras surveil the crime scene, but it is not an optimal solution in its current form \citep{whats-wrong-public-video-surveillance}.
