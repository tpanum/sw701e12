\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter we will give a short introduction to the project, why we have chosen to work in this area and where the focus in the rest of this report lies. \\

This student report is written as part of a learning project. Therefore we must comply with the study regulation.
The study regulation states that the main focus of this semester's project is to gain knowledge of, and develop: Internet applications, -agents, or -services.
The goal is thus to create an Internet application that provides a service with focus on agent technologies, scalability, and data intensity. \\

When a crime occurs documentation is often needed in order to convict the person(s) responsible and to receive repairs from an insurance company for the damages suffered.
Documentation can be eye witnesses, forensic evidence, or video surveillance.
Documentation in the form of eye witnesses or forensic evidence are unreliable sources, as it is not possible to guarantee it will be available.
Video surveillance is however always obtainable, but it is far from a perfect solution in its current form.\fixme{Statement - source}
