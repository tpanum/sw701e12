\section{Web for Surveillance}
With the development and standardization of network technologies, video surveillance is becoming digitized.
The digitization of video surveillance is important as it e.g. makes it faster to examine a video recording, and video cameras can be programmed to trigger alarms when they detect movement.
Video recordings are examined faster as it is easy to skip through digital data compared to the analog data which would be stored on e.g. a VHS cassette.
The programming of video cameras is possible due to the data being digital. 
It is possible to apply algorithms to examine the digital data, which could e.g. identify license plates on cars.
The digitization allows for the use of the Internet.
The Internet makes it possible to interconnect surveillance solution, that enables features such as backup or long distance observing.
These features should be taken into account when designing a solution in this project.
