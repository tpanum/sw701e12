%Hvad laves projektet som
%Noget med proof of concept
The project will be implemented as if it were a service offered by a company.
Therefore the system is to be developed as if surveillance is to be done at several locations simultaneously.
The hardware available limits the project to a proof of concept, as it is not of a high enough quality to make a system usable in the real world.
This means the system being developed will be developed as one which must be able to surveil several locations simultaneously and be a proof of concept.
