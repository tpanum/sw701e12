\section{Model}
In this section the model of \projectname{} will be presented and explained using the UML notation described in Section~\ref{section:uml_notation}.
First the objects that need to be represented by the model are identified, and then their relationships are described. \\

The tables (and hence classes) has all been named according to the naming conventions in Rails \citep{ror_naming_convention}.

\subsection{Objects}
\label{subsec:objects}
The primary purpose of the system is to connect users and drones to allow the user to interact with a drone by either watching its video fee, controlling its movements or both.
Therefore the users and drones are the primary objects that must be represented in \projectname{}. \\

The system will contain the following objects and relationships:

Objects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User
	\item Company
	\item Role
	\item Privilege
	\item Drone
	\item Flightplan
	\item Action
	\item Instruction
\end{itemize}

The relationship between the objects can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:UML_class_diagram}. 
This figure also serves as the model for the whole system. \\

\end{figure}

The follow section will analyse all the object types in the system, their relationships and why they are built as they are.
The upper part of Figure~\ref{fig:UML_class_diagram} shows the relationship between users, companies and roles/privileges while the lower part of the figure shows the relationship between drones, roles/privileges and flight plans. 


\subsubsection{User}
It is not possible to interact with the system unless you are logged in as a user.
Only a login-page will be visible when the system is visited as a guest.
The system is designed to every individual having their own unique user, allowing the system to to show user-specific objects and allow user-specific access to different parts of the system. \\

A users access to the system will need to be restricted to make suer that any user only accesses what he is permitted too. 
The handling of roles and privileges will be done by the role-model. \\

A user will be identified by his e-mail address which will work as the username.
Each user will also have a password, that is both salted and encrypted in the database, using the SHA-1 encryption algorithm. \\

The user-object serves as the point of entrance for anyone who wishes to use the system, and combined with companies, roles and privileges dictate its options.

A users' access to the system will need to be restricted to make sure that any user only access what he is permitted to.
This restriction will be represented through privileges that grant a user access to different system functionalities.
However, granting privileges directly to a user is not the ideal case in most situations, as a lot of duplicate data can occur.
The system will contain global privileges all users need access to.
Assigning global privileges to each user individually is not an ideal solution.
Therefore this will be handled via roles.
A role will in \projectname{} be a set of privileges and assignable to multiple users.
When assigning a user to a role, the user will automatically get access to any privilege granted to that role.
By doing it that way, a lot of privilege gratings can be saved by adding all users that needs the same privileges to a role. \\

%A drone is controlled by sending a set of ordered instructions\fixme{ref to section when it is written} to the drone.
%A log of flights made by the drone will need to be kept, to be able to recreate previous flights, and examine a flight that might have caused the drone to crash.
%This log will be referenced in the system as a flight plan.
%A flight plan will consist of a set of actions taken by the drone, each referencing a specific instruction send to the drone.

A structured list of the objects can be seen in Figure~\ref{tab:model_objects}.

\subsection{Model Diagram}
A diagram of the model can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:UML_class_diagram}.
It should be noted all tables are named according to the naming conventions in ROR\citep{ror_naming_convention}.
The upper part of Figure~\ref{fig:UML_class_diagram} shows the relationship between users, roles, companies, and privileges.
In the following section all references to tables refer to the tables seen in Figure~\ref{fig:UML_class_diagram}

\subsubsection{User Privilege Relationship}
As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:objects} a role in \projectname{} is a set of privileges.
A role is linked to a set of privileges through the relationship table \verb+Privilege_roles+.
In Rails this relationship is referred to as a many to many association, as a user can be associated with many roles and a role can be associated with many users.
\verb+Privilege_roles+ links the ids of roles to the ids of privileges.
Users and roles are linked in the same manner as roles and privileges.
In the table \verb+Role_Users+ the ids of users to the ids of roles are linked.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/UML_model.pdf}
    \caption{UML Class Diagram of \projectname{}}
    \label{fig:UML_class_diagram}
\end{figure}

However, linking privileges to users only through roles creates cases were maintaining privileges can become troublesome.
As an example a user \verb+u+ might need to have his access to a specific privilege \verb+p+ in a role \verb+r+ that he is a member of, revoked.
A possible solution is to remove the user from \verb+r+ and add him a to new role \verb+r1+ that contains all privileges in \verb+r+ except \verb+p+.
The problem with this solution arises if a new privilege \verb+p1+ is to be added to \verb+r+.
The user \verb+u+ is implicitly a member of \verb+r+, but has the role \verb+r1+ to exclude him from the privilege \verb+p+.
To grant \verb+p1+ to \verb+u+, \verb+p1+ must be added to \verb+r1+ as well as \verb+r+.
Granting privileges only through roles can therefore quickly result in a lot of unstructured data that needs to be maintained. \\

To handle this, users are linked directly to privileges through the relationship table \verb+User_Privileges+.
This table differs from the other relationship tables as it does not just link to id foreign keys.
In Rails, this is referred to as a rich many-to-many associated.
In a rich many-to-many association additional, fields are added to the relationship table.
In \verb+User_Privileges+ users and privileges are linked through ids, with an extra field containing a flag.
This flag defines if the privilege the user is linked to is whitelisted or blacklisted through the relation.
This design makes management of privileges more flexible.

Groups of privileges can be assigned through roles, and should a case arise where a users privileges need to be managed individually this is possible through the \verb+User_Privileges+ relation.

\subsubsection{User Companies Relationship}
Users can grouped together via an entity -- this system define as a Company.
A user can via Companies\_users be linked to a company with the foreign keys of both the user and the company. 
A company can via the Company\_roles table be linked to a role in the same way that a user can be, using the foreign keys for the company and the role. 
This will grant the privileges in the role to all users associated with this company.
Finally a drone can be connected to a company via the Company\_drones table, that also uses foreign keys. 
This is to define which drones are associated with a company.
In the case where a company administrator needs to edit the privileges for a drone in accessible for the company, he needs to be able to see which drones are actually associated with the company. 
That list is made via this many-to-many reference. 

\subsection{Drone Flight Plan Relationship}
The flight logging system consists directly of the classes \verb+Drones+, \verb+Flight_plan+ and \verb+Actions+.
Drones are linked to flight plans through a foreign key.
A flight plan is connected to a set of actions through a one-to-many relation.
The actions must be numbered representing the order in which the actions were send to the drone.
This numbering will be managed in the \verb+Flight_Action_Relationship+ with the field \verb+rank+.
An action will be linked to an instruction.
Instruction represent the set of AT commands that can be send to the drone to control.\fixme{Ref til AT command sektion når den skrives}

Through this model the log for a flight with a given drone can be extracted by locating all action associated with the flight plan through the \verb+Flight_Action_Relationship+.

%\subsection{Privileges}
%A user is granted privileges through a whitelist.
%Every privilege not found in a users whitelist is implicitly blacklisted.
%As described in Section~\ref{subsec:objects} a user can be granted privileges through roles.
%There are however a set of cases where handling privileges only through roles is not ideal.
%As an example a user \verb+u+ might need to have his access to a specific privilege \verb+p+ in a role \verb+r+, he is a member of, revoked.
%A possible solution is to remove the user from \verb+r+ and add him a to new role \verb+r1+ that contains all privileges in \verb+r+ except \verb+p+.
%The problem with this solution arises if a new privilege \verb+p1+ is to be added to \verb+r+.
%The user \verb+u+ is natively a member of \verb+r+, but has the role \verb+r1+ to exclude him from the privilege \verb+p+.
%To grant \verb+u+ \verb+p1+, \verb+p1+ must be added to \verb+r1+ as well as \verb+r+.
%Granting privileges only through roles can therefore quickly result in a lot of unstructured data that needs to be maintained.
%To solve privileges need to be manageable on the user level.


%As an example a user might need a specific privilege that allows him to fly a specific drone.
%Adding the user to a group \verb+p+ with that privilege would not work as he would then additionally receive every other privilege in \verb+p+.
%The problem can be solved by giving each user a personal role containing all their uniquely assigned privileges.
