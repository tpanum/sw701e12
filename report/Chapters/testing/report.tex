\section{Report - First test run}
\label{sec:testing_report}

All of the acceptance tests were run.
The tests that were successful and accepted can be seen in the appendix along with the other tests.
One can expect that those tests that were accepted are fully implemented in \projectname{}, are functional and ready to use. 
Those test that failed will be covered in this section.
