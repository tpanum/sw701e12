\section{Report - Test run}
\label{sec:testing_report}

The acceptance tests will be run once by two teams of two persons each. 
All of the acceptance tests were run.
The tests that were successful and accepted can be seen in the appendix along with the other tests.
One can expect that those tests that were accepted are fully implemented in \projectname{}, are functional and ready to use. 
Those test that failed will be covered in this section. \\

The acceptance test results leads to the following three conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The primary functions of \projectname{} are implemented and working. 
	\item However, some of the functionality can be improved and made more user-friendly. 
	\item The failed acceptance tests listed in Table~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests_results_first_run} are not needed for a proof-of-concept solution, but they are needed before \projectname{} can be considered ready-to-market.
\end{itemize}
