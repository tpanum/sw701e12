\section{Test Report}
\label{sec:testing_report}
%The acceptance tests will be performed once by two teams of two persons each. 

All tests result can be seen in Appendix~\ref{appendix:acceptance_test_results}.
The functionality associated with the tests that passes is fully implemented in \projectname{}.
The tests that failed will be covered in this section. \\

From the acceptance tests results the following can be derived:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The primary functions of \projectname{} are implemented and working. 
	\item Some of the functionality can be improved and made more user-friendly. 
	\item The failed acceptance tests listed in Figure~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests_results_first_run} are not needed for a proof of concept solution. 20 of 28 performed tests passed, and as none of the failed tests were associated with functionality needed for a proof of concept, the result was deemed acceptable.
\end{itemize}
