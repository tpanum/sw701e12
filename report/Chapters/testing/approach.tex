\section{Approach}
\label{sec:testing_approach}

All of the acceptance tests were defined in Table~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests1} and Table~\ref{tab:acceptance_tests2}.
All of the tests are manually performed by two teams of two persons each.
The results are logged in Appendix~\ref{appendix:appendix:acceptance_test_results}. \\

A number of use-cases formed the basis of the design and implementation of \projectname{}.
These use-cases also formed the basis of the acceptance-tests that defines what we expect the software to do and how it should behave. 
We have prioritized that black-box testing of our acceptance-tests is sufficient testing of \projectname{}.

% Alternativer:
% unit test
% blackbox er valgt > unit test fordi det kan laves inden programmeringen startes. Så har vi noget at gå efter.
