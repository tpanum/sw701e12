\chapter{Testing}
This chapter will cover the testing of \projectname{}, how it was designed and executed. 
The software was tested as it was developed, making sure that the individual parts worked as intended.
However, after the development is finished, a series of tests are made on the final software, making sure it meets the requirements. 
Those tests are what is covered in this chapter.
