\section{Application Structure}
\label{sec:application_structure}

Web applications have a single point of entry, a hostname, that is translated into an IP address.
The IP address points to a server, which handles HTTP requests from users. 
The users HTTP requests are sent using a Browser, which will is denoted \deno{B}.
This means that a server solution is needed.
Server solutions can either be singleton or distributed with multiple servers.
Singleton server solutions are based on having one server that handles all incoming requests.
This means that singleton server solutions are vulnerable to \acs{DoS} through HTTP requests, but provides consistency.
\acs{DoS} is an attempt to make a service unavailble, which is possible when a service is made available by a singleton server.

    \label{fig:server_solutions}
\end{figure}

Distributed server solutions contain several servers possibly on several locations, meaning that DoS will be harder to perform, since there is no single point of failure.
However, this solution cannot ensure consistency as data needs to be synchronized across several servers and adds complexity.
The two solutions are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:server_solutions}.
A singleton solution has been chosen due to consistency and simplicity.
This singleton solution will be denoted as Master or \deno{M}.
Figure~\ref{fig:server_solutions} only shows a single \deno{B}, as it represents a single \deno{B}'s look at the system.
It should be noted that \deno{M} is capable of handling multiple \deno{B}s at the same time. \\

The application is required to handle communication with drones, as defined by \at{3}.
In case the communication is lost the drone might end up crashing.
The range limitations of antennas for digital wireless communication set a constraint for the availability of drones.
Assuming there exists no antenna capable of covering the entire physical area of our problem domain, it is necessary to have a distributed antenna setup. 
This leads to the structure shown in Figure~\ref{fig:antenna_structure}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gfx/antenna_structure.pdf}
    \caption{Antenna structure.}
    \label{fig:antenna_structure}
\end{figure}

If all \deno{B}'s communication with the drones goes through \deno{M}, this would create a single point of failure.
This means that, if \deno{M} crashes at any point, all communication with the drones will be lost.
Providing the antennas with processing power and opportunity to communicate directly with \deno{B} would solve this issue.
If an antenna crashes, then only the drones connected to that antenna would be disconnected, leaving the drones connected to other antennas untouched.
This could be achieved by distributing some of the communication from \deno{M}.
This is solved by combining the antennas with distributed processing units, which will be denoted as Slaves or \deno{S}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:slave_structure}. \\

As \deno{S} has a different network position than\deno{M}, this enforces that \deno{B} is not able to communicate directly with \deno{S} before getting network information about \deno{S} from \deno{M}. This communication is illustrated by a dashed line in Figure~\ref{fig:slave_structure}. \\

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gfx/slave_structure.pdf}
    \caption{Slave structure.}
    \label{fig:slave_structure}
\end{figure}

The acceptance tests, e.g. \at{17}, \at{24}, and \at{25} enforce a constraint that requires \deno{M} to be able to store data based of the interaction of the user.
Since requests can happen asynchronously, a relational database denoted \deno{DB} is used to store this data. 
This choice was made as relational database is able to receive data at any time and let other processes handle it later.\\

The response from \deno{M} to \deno{B} needs to be dynamic based on the user, e.g. \at{2}, which requires \deno{M} to be capable of processing data and store it in the database.
The processing unit that creates the dynamic response will be denoted \deno{W}.
The communication with the drones is handled by another processing unit, denoted \deno{D}.
If \deno{W} was to handle requests from \deno{S} and \deno{B}, this would increase the load on \deno{W}.
By creating multiple request handlers, it is possible to have a process for each. \deno{W}, \deno{DB}, and \deno{D} are processes, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:daemon_structure}. 
This improves resource management.
The resource management could be to constrain processing power for each process or to distribute the processes on individual machines. \\

% The architecture of \projectname{} differs from other web applications due to the fact that there exists two different type of servers.
% The architecture can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:system_architecture}.
% The server where the web application is running is called Master denoted M.
% For each drone in the system there is a Slave denoted S.
% On both M and S there exists daemons which is responsible for different tasks, however there is some similarity in the tasks they perform.
% These tasks can happen at anytime therefore the program needs to be running at anytime. These daemons are denoted D.
% Each user have a browser they view the application through this is denoted B.
% It is M's responsibility to communicate with every S in the system.
% S is responsible for all communication with the drone it is parred with.

% When a user wants to interact with a drone in the system a session key is needed.
% Such a session key is generated by S and then given to B through M.
% When both B and S have the same session key it is possible for them to communicate without M.
% This ensures that M does not become a bottleneck for controlling and streaming from drones and it reduces latency.
% When a new drone is added it is controlled by its S. This ensures that the system can scaled out and not have to scale up.
% Scale out means using more than one server where scale up means adding more processors, ram etc. to the server so it can handle more by itself.
% M does not handle commands and streaming, and every drone in the system have their own S.
% This makes the application architecture scalable because it removes bottlenecks from both M and S's.

%     \label{fig:system_architecture}
% \end{figure}

% The system only uses one M. This can also be seen the bottleneck of the system.
% If M crashes all S's and B's will have to wait for M to come back up.
% One alternative could be running with more M's and in that way scale out.

% There is always one S for each drone connected to the system.
% In this way the system is scaled out.
% This ensures that any S is not likely to become a bottleneck.
% This was done because the drone uses wireless network which is short ranged and the drone is the host which means that the server needs one wireless connection for each drone it have to transmit to.
% One alternative could be only running with one S at each company and just scale it up.
% The problem with this is the server will need a wireless connection for each drone it have to control and it have to be in range.

% Daemon is a background process on a Linux system.
% Daemons are used when it is needed that a process is running at all times.
% In \projectname{} there are both the session key system which both resides on M and S and a policy file system for Adobe Flash on S.
% Both of these processes needs to be running at all times for the user to interact with the drone on S.
