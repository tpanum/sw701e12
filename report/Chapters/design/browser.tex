Users interact with the system by connecting to \deno{M} through \deno{B}.
The user will interact with the system through a web interface, which is retrieved from \deno{M}.
The functionality of \deno{B} is described in Section~\ref{sec:functionality_distribution}.
If \deno{B} interacts with a drone, \deno{B} must be able to display the drone's video stream, and allow the user to send commands to the drone.
The communication with the drone is through \deno{S}, therefore \deno{B} must be able to communicate directly with \deno{S}.

For the user to interact with the system he is required to authenticate in order to establish a connection with \deno{W}. %\fxfatal{Eller W}.
A session that holds the identity of \deno{B} is stored on \deno{M}, and it is used to uphold the user's authentication. %\fixme{Dette er ikke korrekt. Sessions ligger server side, og indeholder ikke credentials.}

To ease the load on \deno{M}, some of the computation is moved from \deno{M} to \deno{B}.
\deno{B} has two types of interaction with \deno{S} as described in Section~\ref{sec:communication_network}.
\deno{B} must be able to display the drone's video stream through a multimedia object.
To control the drone \deno{B} must request a session key from \deno{M} as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sequence_diagram}.
When controlling the drone the video stream must be available to \deno{B}.
