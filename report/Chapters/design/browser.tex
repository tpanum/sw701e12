\section{Browser}
\label{sec:design_client}
Users interact with the system by connecting to \deno{M} through \deno{B}.
This connection is through an Internet browser as described in Section~\ref{sec:application_structure}.
The user will interact with the system through a web interface, which is retrieved from \deno{W}.
The functionality of \deno{B} is described in Section~\ref{sec:functionality_distribution}.
If \deno{B} interacts with a drone, \deno{B} must be able to displays the drones video feed, and allow the user to send commands to the drone.
The communication with the drone is through \deno{S}, therefore \deno{B} must be able to communicate directly with \deno{S}.

For \deno{B} to interact with the system requires authentication to establish a connection with \deno{M}\fxfatal{Eller W}.
The users' credentials is stored on \deno{B} and it is used to uphold the users' authentication.

To ease the load on \deno{W}, some of the processing is moved from \deno{W} to \deno{B}.
\deno{B} has two types of interaction with \deno{S} as described in Section~\ref{sec:communication_network}.
To display the drones video feed, a video player must be present in \deno{B}.
To control the drone \deno{B} must request a session key from \deno{M} as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sequence_diagram}.
When controlling the drone the video feed must be available in \deno{B}.
