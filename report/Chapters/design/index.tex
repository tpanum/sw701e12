\chapter{Design}
This chapter will cover the design of the application by solving design problems, based upon the analysis, of the problem statement. 
The design problems are unfolded by the use cases and acceptance tests from the analysis process. 
The notion of acceptance tests will be of the format \at{X}, where X is the ID of the acceptance test.
The process of creating a solution includes discussion and reasoning behind the choices made throughout the design process.
