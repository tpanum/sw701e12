\chapter{Design}

This chapter explains how a solution to the challenges described previously is designed and modeled. 
It is all designed with scalability in mind, allowing the system to grow in time without having to re-design the model.
We aim to use known design patterns in the design. \\

The user stories and use cases will form the foundation of the design of the model.
