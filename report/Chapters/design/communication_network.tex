\section{Communication network}

The communication network is crucial for \projectname{} to work.
When designing a communication network that have to scale it is important to choose the right structure.
There are different ways when designing such a network but identical for them all is that they need to support the structure of \deno{M}, \deno{S} and \deno{B} as seen in section~\ref{sec:application_structure}.

One solution is to make a structure where \deno{M}, \deno{S} and \deno{B} talk to each other with a level of security. 
The security aspect would be implemented with a form of session key. 
This key would be used to determine if a session between a \deno{B} and a \deno{S} is valid.
Another solution is to provide no security aspect and let it be up to the users and / or company to keep drones safe from intruders.
This would lessen the communication between \deno{B}, \deno{M} and \deno{S}.  
It would also decrease the load on \deno{M} and \deno{S}'s database. 
On the down side the system could be considered not safe because it would be possible to tamper with the drones.
As this is a system where it is important that the integrity is high, evidence is not tampered with, and where the outcome of an unauthorized user controller a drone could be devastating, it is important to deliver some form of security.

    \caption{Sequence diagram of the communication network between \deno{B}, \deno{M}, and \deno{S}}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram}
\end{figure}

This lead to a solution where sessions is designed to keep the integrity and secure evidence as seen in figure~\ref{fig:sequence_diagram}. 
As seen in the figure there is designed a level of security because of the sessions. It is not possible for a \deno{B} to interact with a drone without having a session with a drones \deno{S}.

When a drone is purchased a \deno{S} is setup at the location where the drone is going to operate.
The \deno{S} sends an initializing message to \deno{M}, informing \deno{M} that a new drone has entered the system.
\deno{M} adds the drone with the IP and location of the \deno{S}, along with the drone's unique identifier.
If \deno{M} receives an initializing message from a \deno{S} with a drone identifier that is already in the system, it will destroy any session that correlates with that drone. The sessions is destroyed because if one or more sessions are granted and \deno{S} sends its initializing message it is safe to assume that \deno{S} either disconnected or crashed and all sessions keys are invalid.
Furthermore if the IP of \deno{S} differs from the IP \deno{M} holds in its database it will be updated.

If a user tries to interact with a drone the system behaves differently. A session key will be made on a \deno{S}, this key will be send to \deno{M} and giving to \deno{B}. If this session key is valid it is possible for the user to communicate directly with \deno{S} without \deno{M}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/sessionkey_communication.pdf}
    \caption{Session key communication between \deno{B}, \deno{M}, and \deno{S}}
    \label{fig:sessionkey_communication}
\end{figure}

This behavior can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:sessionkey_communication}. 

Session keys have been designed for security reasons.
Firstly they were designed to ensure that only one user at a time could control a drone.
Secondly it ensured that unauthorized users do not have the possibility of controlling a drone.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Request send from \deno{B} to \deno{M} about getting a session key to interact with a drone.
	\item \deno{M} inserts this request in its database table called SessionKeyTask.
	\item \deno{D} scans the database table SessionKeyTask, when it sees a new entry it select it and then deletes it from the table.
	\item \deno{D} requests a session key from \deno{S} parred with the drone the user wants to interact with.
	\item \deno{S} makes a random generated string with uppercase, lowercase letters and number. This string is used as the session key. \deno{S} updates its database with this session key and then sends it back to \deno{D} on \deno{M}.
	\item \deno{D} inserts the newly received session key into the session table of \deno{M}.
	\item \deno{M} then contacts \deno{B} with the session key.
	\item \deno{B} uses this session key to access \deno{S} and through it interact with the drone.
	\item A Timeout happens if \deno{B} and \deno{S} does not communicate for 10 seconds.
\end{enumerate}

Communication between the servers in the system are crucial. 
Therefore it was important to make a method or methods for communicating between them. 
One method could be to make a service which handles all these requests on each server. 
The problem however is that with only one service there are a possibility for introduction a bottleneck to the system.
Another solution is to make a service for each communication level. One service that handles sessions, a service that handles control commands, and a service that handles initial messages from \deno{S} see section~\ref{sec:application_structure}.

This lead to a solution where the different actors in the system delivered and / or depended on services.

The interface of the communication network can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:communication_network}.

The communication network of \projectname{} uses four different ports for providing its services:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Port A - service port for sending and receiving drone control commands.
	\item Port B - service port for receiving and sending initial messages.
	\item Port C - service port for sending and receiving session information including session keys.
	\item Port Web - service port for sending and receiving web specific information.
\end{itemize}

When designing a communication network it is also important to select the right technique for exchanging data between services.
One of the more widely used techniques are Extensible Markup Language.
Extensible Markup Language, or XML for short, is a markup language designed to easily mark up data.
The markup that XML provides makes it possible to easily send and receive data.
The Extensible in XML makes it possible to extent what data types XML can handle through the XML schema. \citep{simonstl}
This gives XML a drawback because XML is designed to be extensible it also carries a lot of overhead when used to mark up data.

\projectname{} needs to be scalable therefore it is important to use as little overhead when sending structured information.
Otherwise there is a chance that this overhead creates a bottleneck within the network.

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is design for data interchange and to be human-readable.
It have a simpler syntax than XML and is not build to be extensible, it is not even a markup language. 
It is a structured way of exchanging data between sources. 
This results in less overhead i.e. it costs less data for each piece of information. 
JSON is also data orientated which makes it easier to map a JSON object directly to a object orientated structure.
Douglas Crockford call JSON ``The Fat-Free Alternative to XML'' \citep{JSON}.

Therefore JSON is the perfect format for data interchange between the different services in \projectname{}. There are lesser costs associated with JSON than XML and it is easier to map them into a object orientated language.
