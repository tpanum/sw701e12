\section{Functionality distribution}

While Section~\ref{sec:application_structure} covered the overall structure of this application, this section will cover how the functionality is divided between the Master and the Slaves in the system. \\

The Master is the users only way into the system. 
This access will always be via the users local web browser, where he sees the web system for \projectname{}.
This web system and the database containing all informations about the system, drones, users etc. will be located on the Master. 
The Master is responsible for providing these services and coordinating the communication between the users and drones via the Slaves. \\

A Slave is needed for every drone in the field, as the drones are not capable of long-distance communication. 
Therefore, in order to communicate with any drone, the communication must be channeled through its assigned Slave. 
This Slave is responsible for keeping contact with the drone and communicate directly with it via its API's.
