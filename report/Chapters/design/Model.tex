\section{Model}
In this section the model of \projectname{} will be presented and explained.
First the objects that needs to be represented by the model are identified, and then their relationships will be described.

\subsection{Objects}
The core aspects that must be represented is users and drones.
An users' access to the system will need to be restricted.
This restriction will be represented through privileges that grant an user access to the systems functionalities.
Granting privileges directly to a user is not the ideal case in most situations.
There will be some global privileges all users will have access to, and assigning these to each individual user, will result in a lot of unnecessary data.
This issue is handled with roles.
A role will in \projectname{} be a set of privileges that can be assigned to multiple users.

A drone is controlled by sending a set of ordered instructions\fixme{ref to section when it is written} to the drone.
A log of flights made by the drone will need to be kept, to be able to recreate previous flights, and examine a flight that might have caused the drone to crash.
