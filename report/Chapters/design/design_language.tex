\section{Design Language}

The design language or sometimes called design vocabulary is the design guide lines for \projectname{}. Each object there is important in the application have gotten their own unique feel.

\subsection{Color scheme}

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/color_schema.pdf}
    \caption{color schema of \projectname{}.}
    \label{fig:color_schema}
\end{figure}

The color schema seen in \figref{fig:color_schema} shows the colors which is used in the applications design.

\subsection{Fonts}

The family of fonts will be: Arial, Helvetica. These fonts have been selected because they are common both in Windows and Mac and therefore can be called browser safe \cite{common_fonts}.

\subsection{Shapes}

All boxes which is possible to interact with in the application have rounded corners. This was done because the interaction for the user should be simple and straight forward.

\subsection{Layouts}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/menu.pdf}
    \caption{The menu of the application, with the control menu point activated.}
    \label{fig:menu_design}
\end{figure}

In \figref{fig:menu_design} the menu of the application is seen. The control menu point is active and therefore is represented with a gray color. Else the menu is black and with white spacers.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/search.pdf}
    \caption{Search bar of the application}
    \label{fig:search_bar_design}
\end{figure}

In \figref{fig:search_bar_design} the search bar of the application is seen. The ``search'' text will disappear when clicked and if the user types anything this will be shown in the search bar instead.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/table.pdf}
    \caption{Table design for the application.}
    \label{fig:table_design}
\end{figure}

In \figref{fig:table_design} the general design for tables of the application is seen. Odd rows will be light blue and even rows will be blue.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{gfx/list.pdf}
    \caption{List design for the application.}
    \label{fig:list_design}
\end{figure}

The list design seen in \figref{fig:list_design} is the core list item in the application. This list can show more and less information depending on where the user clicks. All levels are represented in \figref{fig:list_design} where a dark blue tab item with a name is a user in the system, the blue is a drone and the light blue is the privilege for the selected drone.
The list is made in such a way that the levels can be distinguished by the indent of the item.
The boxes in \figref{fig:list_design} shows the privilege status of an item. There are three different states these boxes can be in

\begin{itemize}
	\item Not marked
	\item Dotted
	\item ticked
\end{itemize}
 
If a box is not marked like ``Drone 1337'' the user have no privileges for this drone. If a box is dotted the user have some privileges for this drone like ``Drone 42''. If a box is ticked the user have all privileges for this drone e.g. Drone 1.

    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{gfx/button.pdf}
    \caption{Button design for the application.}
    \label{fig:button_design}
\end{figure}

The \projectname{} application have also gotten its own button design seen in \figref{fig:button_design}. There are three different groups of buttons and six buttons in total.
These buttons is used to navigate the site, make a selection for add or remove or accepting or declining depending on the situation.
