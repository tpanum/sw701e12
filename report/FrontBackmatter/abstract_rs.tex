\chapter*{Abstract}
Video surveilance is becoming more and more used around the world.
Governments use it to prevent criminal activities and terror, while the private sector use it to surveil their property and for gathering crime related evidence.
The manner in which video surveillance technologies are used today is, however, quite expensive and has its limitations such as the amount of needed hardware to get a sufficient degree of surveilance and the installation costs of this equipment. \\

This report seeks to take advantage of modern technologies to provide video surveillance of large areas in a cost-efficient way. 
A proof of concept solution that uses unmanned air-crafts with mounted cameras -- drones -- and a web-interface for user interacting based on a scalable infrastructure is designed and implemented.
The goal is a scalable web-application allowing one users to pilot a drone and multiple users to view the video stream from such drones to do remote and cost-efficient surveillance of large areas. \\

The system developed in this student project is a proof of concept solution showing that using drones to surveil large areas is possible with todays technologies.
