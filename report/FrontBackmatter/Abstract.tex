\chapter*{Abstract}
Video surveilance is becoming more and more used around the world.
Governments use it in big cities to prevent criminal activities and terror, while privates use it to surveil their property and have evidence if a crime happens.
The ways that the technology allows us to video surveil today is, however, quite expensive and has its limitations such as the amount of needed hardware to get a sufficient degree of surveilance and the installation costs of this equipment. \\

This paper seeks to take advantage of modern technology to provide a new way of video surveil large areas in a cost-efficient way. 
A proof of concept solution that uses unmanned air-crafts with mounted cameras -- drones -- and a web-interface for user interacting based on a scalable infrastructure is designed and implemented.
The goal is a scalable web-application that allows multiple users to control and view the video stream from such drones to do remote and cost-efficient surveilance of large areas. \\

The system that was developed in this student project is a proof of concept solution that shows that -- with better hardware than what was available in this project -- a product that uses drones to surveil large areas is possible to deploy.
