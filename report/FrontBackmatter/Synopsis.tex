Video surveillance is becoming more and more used around the world.
The ways technology allow us to video surveil today is, however, quite expensive and has its limitations.
This paper seeks to take advantage of modern technology to provide a new approach of video surveil large areas in a cost-efficient way. 
The goal is a scalable web-application that allows multiple users to control and view the video stream unmanned air-crafts to do remote and cost-efficient surveillance of large areas.
